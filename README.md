**1. Word Clustering in Literary Texts: A Co-occurrence and Graph based Approach**

This project investigates how unsupervised learning can be used to group words based on their meanings by analyzing how often they appear together in a set of literary texts. We use both direct
co-occurrence patterns and graph-based refinements (via Dijkstra’s algorithm) to understand how different ways of measuring word distance affect the structure and clarity of the resulting groups.

**2. Report on Investigating Logistic Regression and Neural Networks on a Nonlinear Dataset**
 
 This report investigates how well Logistic Regression and Neural Networks perform on a two-dimensional
 dataset with a nonlinear decision boundary. The boundary is defined by the equation:
 
 y =ax^2 +x
 
 where x is a randomly sampled value from the range [−2,2],
 
 and the corresponding y value is computed
 based on the equation. Points on one side of the boundary are assigned to Class A, while points on
 the other side are assigned to Class B. The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the
 performance of Logistic Regression and Neural Networks on this dataset as we vary the following
 factors:
 
 • The boundary curvature parameter a.
 
 • The number of data points in the dataset.
 
 • The balance between Class A and Class B.
 
 • The size of the Neural Network architecture.
 
 We assess model performance using accuracy as the main evaluation metric, while also looking at
 confusion matrices and ROC curves for additional insights
